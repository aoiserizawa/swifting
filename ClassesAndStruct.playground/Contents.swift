//If you create an instance of a structure and assign that instance to a constant, you cannot modify the instanceâ€™s properties, even if they were declared as variable properties:

// the DataImporter instance for the importer property has not yet been created

//Part of the functionality of the DataManager class is the ability to import data from a file. This functionality is provided by the DataImporter class, which is assumed to take a non-trivial amount of time to initialize. This might be because a DataImporter instance needs to open a file and read its contents into memory when the DataImporter instance is initialized.

// Because it is marked with the lazy modifier, the DataImporter instance for the importer property is only created when the importer property is first accessed, such as when its fileName property is queried:

print(manager.importer.fileName)
